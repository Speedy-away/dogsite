# Scooby Left 4 Dead Lua API 1.0

## L4D quick start

**Lua > API docs** opens a scrollable L4D1/L4D2 snippet guide without toolbar controls. Select code and press Ctrl+C, then paste it into **Lua > Editor**. Each example runs independently. The guide ships as `docs/LUA_SNIPPETS.md`; this full reference remains in `docs/LUA_API.md`.

The `l4d` host API works with the L4D1 and L4D2 game adapters. It supplements the portable UI, rendering, events, hotkeys and feature/config APIs. `L4D_API_VERSION == "1.0"` identifies this host extension; `UI_API_VERSION` identifies the portable UI API separately.

Open **Lua > Scripts**, select an example and run it. Bundled scripts are copied into the active profile's script library on startup without overwriting your edited copies. They do not auto-run. New native APIs require a host built from this source; copying Lua files alone cannot add native functions to an older DLL.

Included examples:

- **L4D Entity Overlay.lua**: separate actor/pickup ESP, optional skeletons, range and category controls using the custom Scooby widgets.
- **L4D Player HUD.lua**: health, movement state, speed, active weapon and reload/clip information.
- **L4D Nearby Threats.lua**: distance warnings for specials and witches.
- **L4D Native Hook.lua**: an inactive template for a verified function-entry pattern and signature.

```lua
assert(L4D_API_VERSION == "1.0", "Update the Scooby L4D host")
l4d.watch {survivors=false, infected=true, pickups=false, range=60}
ui.overlay("specials", function()
    for _, e in ipairs(l4d.entities {special=true}) do
        local p = l4d.world_to_screen(e.position)
        if p and p.on_screen then
            render.text(p.x, p.y, e.name, {1,.4,.3,1})
        end
    end
end)
```

## L4D snapshots and lifetime

The engine thread captures copied data; the snapshot API never dereferences an entity or calls engine interfaces. The separate native-hook extension below has its own thread, ABI and lifetime contract. All callbacks within a UI frame read one pinned snapshot. `sequence` identifies that capture, not an entity's lifetime. A rendered frame can reuse a previous engine capture. Entity indices may be recycled: reacquire entities each callback and do not assume an index identifies the same actor across frames or maps.

`session().insecure` remains a diagnostic report of the command line, not an access requirement.

Game data follows the host's existing session gate (an allowed local session; no launch flags required). On disconnection, map change or a stopped host, `local_player()` and `camera()` return nil, entity queries return empty/nil and projection returns nil after the next capture. `session().allowed` is false in the standalone preview; `data_available` may be true there for explicitly synthetic data. The preview is not live-game validation.

Returned tables are independent copies. Editing them does not change the game or later queries. Read functions work at top level or inside callbacks, but game data may not exist during script loading. Perform ongoing logic in `events.on("update", ...)`; draw only in UI/overlay callbacks.

## L4D session and player

| Function | Return |
| --- | --- |
| `l4d.info()` | `{api_version, game_id, game, map, preview, sequence, engine_time, max_entities}`. `game_id` is `l4d1`, `l4d2`, `preview`, or empty before attachment. Time is engine time in seconds, not wall-clock time. |
| `l4d.session()` | `{allowed, data_available, preview, stopped, insecure, in_game, connected, loopback, demo, local_player, menu_open, reason}`. `local_player` here is a boolean. |
| `l4d.local_player()` | Player table below, or nil. No entity subscription required. |
| `l4d.camera()` | `{position, angles, width, height, sequence}` or nil. Position is the captured local eye position; angles are engine view angles. Projection uses the captured engine world-to-screen matrix, which can differ from the eye in spectator/third-person views. |
| `l4d.status()` | Human-readable host/session status (existing API). |
| `l4d.metrics()` | Three values: horizontal speed in Source units/s, built-in scene entity count, receive-property count (existing API). This entity count is independent of Lua subscriptions. |

Player fields: `index`, `sequence`, `team`, `health`, `flags`, `water_level`, `move_type`, `alive`, `on_ground`, `incapacitated`, `hanging`, `position`, `eye_position`, `velocity`, `view_angles`, `speed`, and optional `weapon`. `speed` is horizontal Source units per second; velocity is Source units per second on each axis. Team numbers are raw engine team IDs (2 survivors, 3 infected).

`weapon` is `{index, class_name, clip?, reloading?}`. It is absent when there is no active weapon. Clip/reload fields are absent if the receive table does not expose them; clip may be -1 for weapons without a magazine. No reserve-ammo value is invented.

## L4D entity subscriptions

`l4d.watch(options)` replaces this script's subscription and returns its normalized options. Options: `survivors=true`, `infected=true`, `pickups=true`, `bones=false`, `range=150`. Range is metres and clamps to 1-300. Unknown keys, non-boolean flags, non-finite values and wrong types produce Lua errors. `l4d.watch(false)` releases the subscription immediately on the UI side.

Subscriptions take effect on the next engine capture, so queries directly after a change may still show the previous capture. They are removed on stop, reload and failed script loading. Requests from running scripts are merged into one native scan; each script's queries still obey its own categories/range/bone flag. The merged scan may collect more data than one script requested. A disabled feature should release its subscription, as shown by the examples.

Collection is independent of built-in ESP, radar and infected/category toggles. It includes at most 512 recognized, non-dormant, non-local survivors/infected/unowned pickups, in engine-index order within the requested range. Known dead actors and held/owned pickups are excluded. It is not an enumeration of all Source classes. Actors without networked health remain available with nil health. Bone capture also enables animated hitbox fitting and costs more than basic snapshots.

| Function | Return |
| --- | --- |
| `l4d.capture()` | `{requested, captured, truncated, sequence, entity_count}`. Requested is this script's options; captured is the merged options used for this snapshot. Count/truncation describe the merged snapshot, not a filtered query. |
| `l4d.entities([filter])` | Dense array of entity tables. No subscription means an empty array. |
| `l4d.entity(index)` | One currently subscribed entity or nil. |
| `l4d.bones(index)` | Array of `{bone, parent, from, to}` segments. Empty if absent, unsubscribed, or bones were not requested/available. Bone and parent are zero-based engine bone indices; the array uses Lua's one-based indexing. |
| `l4d.screen_box(index)` | `{left, top, right, bottom, width, height, fitted}` in pixels, or nil. `fitted` means animated body hitboxes were used; otherwise actor collision hull or pickup world bounds are used. Near-plane clipping and viewport clamping are applied to native snapshot boxes. |

`entities` filter fields are optional and intersect the subscription: `category="all"|"survivor"|"infected"|"pickup"`, `type="tank"` (exact stable type string), `range=300` (metres, clamps 0-300), `special=true|false`. An unknown type returns an empty result. `special=false` includes non-special actors and pickups; combine it with `category="infected"` to get common/uncommon/witch only. Projection and boxes indicate where an entity projects, not whether a wall occludes it; there is no line-of-sight trace API.

Entity fields: `index`, `sequence`, `team`, `category`, `type`, `name`, `class_name`, `model`, `position`, `bounds_min`, `bounds_max`, `distance_m`, `health?`, `max_health?`, `alive`, `incapacitated`, `hanging`, `special`, `bones_available`. Bounds are absolute world AABB corners, not offsets. `name` is a classified display label, not a Steam/player nickname. Survivor max health falls back to 100 when unavailable; infected maximum health is absent when not networked. For pickups, `alive` is a generic active-entity flag, not an actor life state.

| Category | `type` values |
| --- | --- |
| survivor | `survivor` |
| infected | `unknown`, `common`, `uncommon`, `witch`, `smoker`, `boomer`, `hunter`, `spitter`, `jockey`, `charger`, `tank` |
| pickup | `weapons`, `melee`, `throwables`, `medical`, `ammo`, `upgrades`, `carryables` |

`special` includes unknown special infected and smoker/boomer/hunter/spitter/jockey/charger/tank. Witches are separate. Games only return types present in that game/map; L4D2-only types do not appear in stock L4D1. Classification uses the existing class/model classifier and can return `unknown` for custom mods.

## L4D projection and math

Vectors are Lua tables `{x=..., y=..., z=...}` in **Source coordinates and units**, with Z up. Angles use the same table shape: X pitch, Y yaw, Z roll, in degrees. Internal portable renderer coordinate conversion is handled by the host. Distances explicitly named `_m` and subscription/filter ranges are metres. Inputs must be finite numbers of magnitude at most 1e9.

| Function | Return |
| --- | --- |
| `l4d.world_to_screen(position)` | `{x, y, on_screen}` in physical pixels, or nil behind/outside the camera depth range or without game data. An offscreen point can return a table with `on_screen=false`. |
| `l4d.vec.add(a,b)`, `sub(a,b)` | Component sum/difference vector. |
| `l4d.vec.scale(v,n)` | Scaled vector. |
| `l4d.vec.dot(a,b)` | Scalar dot product. |
| `l4d.vec.length(v)`, `distance(a,b)` | Length/distance in the input's units. |
| `l4d.vec.normalize(v)` | Unit vector or nil for near-zero length. |
| `l4d.angle_to(eye,point)` | Source pitch/yaw/roll vector pointing toward a position. |
| `l4d.angle_fov(from,to)` | Angular distance between view-angle vectors in degrees. |
| `l4d.to_metres(units)`, `l4d.to_units(metres)` | Unit conversion; one Source unit is treated as .0254 metres by this project. |

DirectX and OpenGL use the same snapshot and projection APIs. Rendering still uses `render.*` from an overlay/UI callback.

## L4D feature integration

Use `features.add` to register your toggle/hotkey and `features.active` to gate behavior. Registered feature enabled state/hotkeys participate in the existing config system. Plain Lua locals such as the example sliders are per-run and are not automatically persisted. Use `features.list()` to discover actual IDs; `features.set`, `features.bind`, `features.color` and `ui.feature` also work with built-in IDs.

`l4d.setting(id, field [, value])` reads or updates the following numeric built-in properties. It returns the clamped value, truncating style indices to integers. Unknown ID/field pairs error. Non-finite values reset to that property's lower bound, preserving the existing setting API behavior. Changing a numeric property does not automatically enable its feature.

| ID | Field and values |
| --- | --- |
| `chams.visible`, `chams.hidden` | `style`: 0 Lit, 1 Flat, 2 Chrome, 3 Ghost, 4 Additive, 5 Wireframe, 6 Glass, 7 Glow, 8 Fullbright, 9 Chrome wireframe, 10 Ghost wireframe, 11 Neon wireframe |
| `chams.<target>.custom`, `chams.<target>.hidden` | `style`: same material indices; target IDs and pass switches below |
| `chams.enabled` | `style`: legacy alias for `chams.visible` (Players visible material) |
| `chams.selector`, `infected.selector`, `items.box` | `style`: selected category/type/box-style index; clamped to that feature's choices |
| `l4d.items`, `chams.enabled`, `infected.<type>` | `distance`: 1-300 metres |
| `l4d.items` | `textSize`: 10-24 pixels |
| `chams.pulse` | `thickness`: pulse frequency .5-5 Hz |
| `actor.box_padding` | `distance`: 0-10 percent |
| `actor.box_width`, `actor.box_height` | `distance`: legacy scale 25-100 / 50-100 percent |
| `aim.profile`, `aim.mode`, `aim.point` | `style`: profile 0 Legit/1 Rage; mode 0 Camera/1 Silent/2 Packet silent; hitboxes 0 Upper body / 1 Chest / 2 Head / 3 Stomach / 4 Arms / 5 Legs / 6 All |
| `aim.priority` | `style`: 0 Crosshair, 1 Special infected, 2 Survivors, 3 Common infected; reorders eligible candidates without changing FOV/range/visibility |
| `aim.legit`, `aim.rage`, `aim.range` | `distance`: FOV 1-180 degrees / FOV 1-180 degrees / range 1-300 metres |
| `aim.smoothing` | `distance`: 1-30 |
| `trigger.hitbox`, `trigger.rage.hitbox` | `style`: the same 0-6 hitbox choices as `aim.point`; default 6 All |
| `trigger.delay`, `trigger.range`, `trigger.rage.delay`, `trigger.rage.range` | `distance`: 0-500 ms / 1-300 metres |
| `view.thirdperson_distance`, `view.thirdperson_side`, `view.thirdperson_height` | `distance`: 40-200 / -40 to +40 / -30 to +30 Source units; enable with `features.set("view.thirdperson", true)`, no preset shortcut |
| `view.camera_fov`, `view.model_fov`, `view.offset_x`, `view.offset_y`, `view.offset_z` | `distance`: camera/model FOV in degrees or viewmodel offset in Source units, clamped to the feature's menu bounds |

### Anti-aim controls

```lua
-- Explicit opt-in. The normal host session, input and weapon gates still apply.
l4d.setting("antiaim.yaw", "style", 4) -- Spin
l4d.setting("antiaim.pitch", "style", 0) -- Keep view pitch
l4d.setting("antiaim.spin", "distance", 180) -- degrees per second
features.set("antiaim.enabled", true)
-- Stop again:
features.set("antiaim.enabled", false)
```

`antiaim.pitch.style`: 0 View, 1 Down, 2 Up, 3 Zero, 4 Jitter, 5 Custom. `antiaim.yaw.style`: 0 Backwards, 1 Left, 2 Right, 3 Jitter, 4 Spin, 5 Random, 6 Distortion, 7 Switch, 8 View. Numeric `distance` fields are `antiaim.custom_pitch` (-89â€“89), `antiaim.yaw_offset` (-180â€“180), `antiaim.jitter` (0â€“180), and `antiaim.spin` (30â€“1440 degrees/s). `features.set("antiaim.invert", true)` adds 180 degrees to yaw.

`l4d.keybind("antiaim.key", action, value)` uses the existing capture/clear/mode interface. `capture` waits 0.5 seconds; `mode` accepts 0 Always, 1 Toggle, 2 Hold, 3 Hold to disable. The master switch remains independent of its binding.

### Visual utility actions

Use `features.trigger(id)` to run an action once, or `ui.feature(id)` to draw its button and optional shortcut control. These actions have no assigned hotkeys and do not appear in the active-features list. They edit the existing saved feature settings.

| Action ID | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `view.swap_shoulder` | Negates the current shoulder offset; a centered/invalid offset selects +20. Does not enable third person. |
| `view.center_camera` | Sets the shoulder offset to zero. |
| `world.night`, `world.warm`, `world.cool` | Enables coordinated world/prop/sky tint colors. |
| `world.reset` | Disables all three tint overrides so the material controller restores original colors. |
| `chams.copy_pass` | Copies the selected target's Visible color/alpha/material to Invisible. |
| `chams.swap_passes` | Exchanges the selected target's Visible and Invisible color/alpha/material. |

Chams actions preserve target enable state, both pass switches and hotkeys. Set `chams.selector` first when invoking them from a script. Other targets remain unchanged.

The shared `ui.tr` API also works in L4D scripts. Format its logical string before passing it to `imgui.text` or `render.text` so live language selection and right-to-left text work correctly; see the bundled portable localization reference.

### Chams targets and passes

Enable `chams.enabled`, then enable each desired target. Target enable IDs are `chams.survivors` (other survivor players), `chams.self` (your world player model), `chams.arms`, `chams.held` (first-person weapon/held supplies), `chams.weapons` (dropped firearms/melee), `chams.pickups` (dropped items), `chams.world_weapon` (your active held world model), and `chams.common`, `chams.uncommon`, `chams.witch`, `chams.smoker`, `chams.boomer`, `chams.hunter`, `chams.spitter`, `chams.jockey`, `chams.charger`, `chams.tank`, `chams.unknown`. `chams.special` is an additional master switch for Smoker through Unknown special; Witch has its own independent toggle. Self requires the game to draw the local world model, for example with `view.thirdperson`.

Players use `chams.visible` / `chams.hidden` for Visible / Invisible. Every other target uses `<target ID>.custom` / `<target ID>.hidden`. Each pass has an independent enabled state, color (including alpha), hotkey and material. Use `features.set`, `features.color`, `features.bind`, and `l4d.setting(pass_id, "style", material_index)` respectively. Invisible is the ignore-depth pass: hidden surfaces show through geometry. With Visible off, the original model covers unoccluded surfaces. Both passes off leaves the original model underneath any enabled overlay. Arms/Weapon use the game's separate first-person projection, so Invisible may look the same as Visible there.

Every target also supports `<target ID>.overlay`, including `chams.survivors.overlay` for Players. It uses the same `features.set`, `features.color`, `features.bind`, and `l4d.setting(..., "style", 0..26)` controls independently of the base passes. Overlay draws at normal depth after Visible, or after the original model when Visible is off. It defaults off with white Wireframe (5), alpha 0.3, and no key. Missing materials or zero alpha skip this extra draw. `chams.overlay` itself retains its legacy **Keep original model** meaning; it is not the new per-target layer. Host schema 4 saves overlays; older configs reset absent overlay IDs to their disabled defaults without changing explicit overlay entries.

```lua
-- Red players with blue-white lightning over the base.
features.set("chams.enabled", true)
features.set("chams.survivors", true)
features.set("chams.visible", true)
l4d.setting("chams.visible", "style", 1) -- Flat
features.color("chams.visible", 1, 0.1, 0.1, 1)
features.set("chams.survivors.overlay", true)
l4d.setting("chams.survivors.overlay", "style", 15) -- Lightning overlay
features.color("chams.survivors.overlay", 1, 1, 1, 0.8)
```

Every Visible/Invisible/Overlay pass also has `<pass ID>.animation`, `<pass ID>.animation_speed` and `<pass ID>.animation_amount`. Enable the first with `features.set` (or `features.bind` / `ui.keybind`) to override shared effects for that layer. Its `style` is 0 Static color, 1 Color wave, 2 Pulse opacity, 3 Rainbow colors, 4 Shimmer, 5 Ember flicker, 6 Color surge, 7 Color steps. `features.color` on this animation ID sets the Color wave/Color surge/Color steps secondary RGB; secondary alpha is unused. The speed and amount IDs use `l4d.setting(id, "distance", value)` with 0.05â€“3 Hz and 0â€“1 respectively. A disabled override inherits the old shared effects. Static and zero Strength preserve the layer's configured RGBA; scrolling VMT textures retain their preset UV animation. Host schema 5 resets absent layer overrides and the new world-weapon target when loading older profiles, retaining explicit entries.

```lua
-- Independent arms overlay rainbow; Self and Weapon retain their own settings.
features.set("chams.arms.overlay.animation", true)
l4d.setting("chams.arms.overlay.animation", "style", 3)
l4d.setting("chams.arms.overlay.animation_speed", "distance", 0.5)
l4d.setting("chams.arms.overlay.animation_amount", "distance", 0.7)
```

The old `.custom` IDs now represent the **Visible switch**, not a global-appearance inheritance option. Loading an old profile automatically copies inherited global colors/materials into each target, preserves explicit equipment appearances, and turns Visible on where the old Custom appearance switch was off. Old first-person hidden passes remain off. After migration, targets are independent; new profiles retain explicit Visible/Invisible choices. Scripts that used `.custom` to switch inheritance should use the new pass semantics instead. `chams.enabled` remains the overall on/off switch; its old color property is unused. The `style` compatibility alias is provided through `l4d.setting`, not direct access to the feature's legacy style property.

`chams.selector` indices are 0 Players, 1 Arms, 2 Weapon, 3 Dropped weapons, 4 Items, 5 Self, 6 Common, 7 Uncommon, 8 Witch, 9 Smoker, 10 Boomer, 11 Hunter, 12 Spitter, 13 Jockey, 14 Charger, 15 Tank, 16 Unknown special, 17 Held weapon (world). Selection only changes which settings the menu edits; it does not enable or disable targets. The grouped Target / Infected type dropdowns resolve to these same indices; the new menu organization does not renumber configs or script settings.

```lua
features.set("chams.enabled", true)
features.set("chams.tank", true)
features.set("chams.special", true)
features.set("chams.tank.custom", true) -- Visible
features.set("chams.tank.hidden", true) -- Invisible
features.color("chams.tank.custom", 0.3, 0.8, 1, 1)
features.color("chams.tank.hidden", 1, 0.25, 0.3, 0.6)
l4d.setting("chams.tank.custom", "style", 8) -- Fullbright
l4d.setting("chams.tank.hidden", "style", 11) -- Neon wireframe
```

```lua
-- Explicit user action: integrate a built-in view setting into a custom page.
ui.subtab("settings", "my_view", "My view", function()
    ui.feature("view.camera_fov")
    local fov = l4d.setting("view.camera_fov", "distance")
    local changed, value = ui.slider("Camera FOV", fov, 60, 140)
    if changed then l4d.setting("view.camera_fov", "distance", value) end
end)
```

Built-in changes remain after a script stops, as with the portable feature API. If temporarily controlling a feature, save the previous value and restore it in a shutdown callback (avoid overwriting subsequent user/other-script edits). This extension provides snapshots and built-in feature controls; it does not expose raw memory, arbitrary engine commands, game-event subscriptions, entity spawning, command/packet callbacks or arbitrary weapon changes. `update` and `shutdown` remain the supported portable events.

## L4D performance and troubleshooting

Keep ranges modest, request only relevant categories, and leave bones off unless needed. Query once per callback and reuse the result; querying returns new tables. A script has the existing 16 MiB Lua allocator limit, frame callback budget and render-call limit. The examples cap drawn actors/segments to stay within the draw budget.

Empty entities: check `l4d.session()`, register `l4d.watch`, allow an engine capture, check filters/range, and inspect `l4d.capture().truncated`. Bones may be unavailable while a pose is being initialized. Nil health means unavailable, not zero. A missing `l4d`/`L4D_API_VERSION` means the wrong/older host is running. Reload after updating the native host; copying docs or examples only does not update a loaded DLL.

## Aim activation and indicators

`l4d.keybind(id [, action [, mode]])` manages `aim.key` (Legit), `aim.rage.key` (Rage), `trigger.key` (Legit), or `trigger.rage.key` (Rage). It returns `key, mode, capturing, waiting`. Actions are `"capture"` (wait 500 ms, release all keys, then accept a fresh press), `"clear"`, or `"mode"` with 0 Always, 1 Toggle, 2 Hold, 3 Hold to disable. Escape cancels, Delete clears, and losing focus cancels capture. The built-in pages use native `ui.button` and `ui.combo` controls. Bindings persist through the regular config system; scripts can also assign them using `features.bind`.

Aim and trigger keys start unassigned with Hold mode selected. An unassigned key preserves the existing master switch behavior. A bound key is an additional activation condition: it cannot enable a disabled master switch. Aim's Only while firing and Silent/pSilent firing requirements still apply. The 500 ms delay applies to assigning a key, not to firing or aiming.

`aim.rage.circle`, `aim.rage.snapline`, `aim.rage.dot` and the corresponding `aim.legit.*` features have independent switches and RGBA colors. They start off. Enable the main aim switch and select that profile to render its indicators. The FOV circle uses the current camera projection, including zoom and aspect ratio. Its radius represents the configured angular targeting limit; wide cones can extend beyond the viewport, and at 90 degrees or more the boundary is behind the camera. Snapline and dot follow the actual selected aim point only while aim is active; stale, invalid or mismatched-profile targets disappear. They do not depend on ESP being enabled. pSilent retains the most recent shot point during its following packet-flush command without extending the 250 ms expiry.

### Independent combat profiles

Ragebot and Legitbot retain separate enable switches, keys, target filters, modes, aim points, ranges and weapon controls. Viewing a tab does not change the active profile; use its explicit profile button. `aim.profile` remains 0 Legit / 1 Rage. Legacy `aim.enabled`, `aim.mode`, `aim.key`, `aim.point`, `aim.range`, `aim.lock`, `aim.attack`, `aim.visible`, `aim.common`, `aim.special`, `aim.witch`, `aim.survivors` and `weapon.no_recoil` / `weapon.no_spread` now address Legit. The Rage equivalents insert `rage.` after `aim.` or `weapon.`. Angular limits retain `aim.legit` / `aim.rage` for compatibility. Triggerbot has separate `trigger.*` (Legit) and `trigger.rage.*` (Rage) settings, including enable, activation key, delay, range, target filters and hitboxes. Both use the active `aim.profile`; viewing either page does not change it. Each page edits its own profileâ€™s weapon controls. Schema-3 migration copies older shared trigger settings into both profiles and converts Head only into the Head selector.

Old shared configurations are copied into Rage once when loaded; new profiles persist each side independently. Silent and pSilent use exact head/chest hitbox shot angles. Smoothing applies only to Legit Camera mode. Animated aim points do not depend on ESP/skeleton being enabled. Trigger eligibility rejects known-dead entities but does not treat missing common-infected health properties as zero.


### Combat target dropdowns

Ragebot, Legitbot and both Triggerbot pages use a multi-select Targets dropdown. Click Common infected, Special infected, Witch or Survivors to toggle its highlight; the popup stays open for further selections. Clicking outside or pressing Escape closes it. The dropdown edits the existing `common`, `special`, `witch` and `survivors` booleans under `aim.`, `aim.rage.`, `trigger.` or `trigger.rage.`. Existing configs and script-set values carry over, and each profile retains independent selections. The generic Lua control is `ui.multi_combo(label, booleanArray, labels)`.

### Combat hitbox selectors

`l4d.setting(id, "style", selection)` supports `aim.point`, `aim.rage.point`, `trigger.hitbox` and `trigger.rage.hitbox`:

| Value | Selection | Model hitgroups |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Upper body | Head, chest and stomach |
| 1 | Chest | Chest only |
| 2 | Head | Head only |
| 3 | Stomach | Stomach only |
| 4 | Arms | Left and right arms |
| 5 | Legs | Left and right legs |
| 6 | Nearest (aim) / All (trigger) | All available hitboxes; aim ranks their centers by crosshair angle |

Aim resolves centers from the entityâ€™s current hitbox set and animated bone matrices, then chooses the closest eligible point inside the FOV and range. With Visible only enabled it tries another selected point when the closer point is obstructed. It never substitutes another region when a strict selection is missing. One bone setup is shared by all candidate points for that entity; no limb-specific bone indices are assumed between L4D1/L4D2 models. Lock on keeps the entity while rechecking its selected hitboxes each command.

Triggerbot filters the actual shot trace hitgroup, without moving the crosshair. Changing profile or hitbox selection restarts its reaction delay. The legacy `trigger.head` and `trigger.rage.head` script toggles still override the selector while enabled; explicitly writing the corresponding hitbox selector clears that override.

```lua
l4d.setting("aim.point", "style", 2)             -- Legit: head
l4d.setting("aim.rage.point", "style", 6)        -- Rage: nearest hitbox center to the crosshair
l4d.setting("trigger.hitbox", "style", 1)       -- Legit Triggerbot: chest
l4d.setting("trigger.rage.hitbox", "style", 0)  -- Rage Triggerbot: upper body
```


## World skies and animated chams

All effects below are disabled initially and participate in normal configs and hotkeys.
`aim.point` and `aim.rage.point` style `6` are displayed as **Nearest**: all current hitbox centers ranked by angular distance from the crosshair. Triggerbot retains **All** at the same numeric value; it filters the hitgroup intersected by its firing trace.

| Setting ID | Field | Values |
|---|---|---|
| `world.skybox` | `style` | 0 Galaxy, 1 Blue nebula, 2 Crimson nebula, 3 Dawn, 4 Storm, 5 Aurora, 6 Bloodmoon, 7 Synthwave, 8 Frost, 9 Toxic, 10 Sunset, 11 Noir |
| `world.sky_brightness` | `distance` | 0.1â€“2, default 1 |
| `world.sky_speed` | `distance` | 0.05â€“1 Hz, default 0.1 |
| `world.pulse_speed` | `distance` | 0.05â€“1 Hz, default 0.2 |
| `world.pulse_amount` | `distance` | 0â€“0.8, default 0.2 |
| `chams.animation` | `style` | 0 Color wave, 1 Breathing, 2 Shimmer |
| `chams.animation_speed` | `distance` | 0.05â€“3 Hz, default 0.3 |
| `chams.animation_amount` | `distance` | 0â€“1, default 0.65 |

Toggle `world.skybox`, `world.sky_animation`, `world.pulse` and `chams.animation` with `features.set`. Use `features.color` on `world.sky_animation` or `chams.animation` for the accent color. The color-wave mode blends toward that accent; breathing/shimmer modulate the selected material brightness. Existing opacity and rainbow controls still work.

Chams material indices 0â€“13 are unchanged. **12 Galaxy** uses a galaxy texture; **13 Galaxy flow** scrolls that texture. New presets: **14 Lightning**, **15 Lightning overlay** (additive), **16 Plasma flow**, **17 Aurora**, **18 Molten**. Select each target's visible/invisible material independently. TextureScroll animates the new textures; color-animation speed does not change their preset scroll rates. White pass tint preserves texture colors. Use `features.set("chams.overlay", true)` to show the original model beneath Lightning overlay.

```lua
features.set("world.skybox", true)
l4d.setting("world.skybox", "style", 0)
l4d.setting("world.sky_brightness", "distance", 0.8)
features.set("chams.enabled", true)
features.set("chams.held", true)
features.set("chams.held.custom", true)
l4d.setting("chams.held.custom", "style", 13)
features.color("chams.held.custom", 1, 1, 1, 1)
features.set("chams.animation", true)
l4d.setting("chams.animation", "style", 0)
features.color("chams.animation", 0.3, 0.8, 1, 1)
```

Galaxy assets are supplied under `materials/scooby_l4d_vfx_v1`. The host installs only this namespace into the detected game's material directory. Galaxy skies need a compatible map skybox; indoor maps can hide the sky. LDR, HDR and RGBS sky textures are handled separately. Legacy three-exposure HDR skies are left unchanged. Texture bindings and colors are restored when disabled, on level shutdown and on Stop. World breathing is limited to eight material updates per second; sky-only animation never rewrites unchanged world materials.

```lua
-- Lightning weapon and iridescent arms, independently configured.
features.set("chams.enabled", true)
features.set("chams.held", true)
features.set("chams.held.custom", true)
l4d.setting("chams.held.custom", "style", 14)
features.color("chams.held.custom", 1, 1, 1, 1)
features.set("chams.arms", true)
features.set("chams.arms.custom", true)
l4d.setting("chams.arms.custom", "style", 17)
features.color("chams.arms.custom", 1, 1, 1, 1)
```

### Radar type colors

Visuals > Radar > Type colors edits independent radar dot RGBA for 19 L4D categories. Enable **Use type colors**, choose a type, then enable its **Override color**. Per-type keys use the existing keybind modes. Reset category restores only the selected color/override/binding. These controls do not change ESP colors or visibility filters.

Enable the radar with `features.set("overlay.radar", true)` and type coloring with `features.set("radar.type_colors", true)`. Type IDs are `radar.color.` followed by `survivors`, `common`, `uncommon`, `witch`, `smoker`, `boomer`, `hunter`, `spitter`, `jockey`, `charger`, `tank`, `unknown`, `weapons`, `melee`, `throwables`, `medical`, `ammo`, `upgrades`, or `carryables`. Each supports `features.set`, `features.color` and `features.bind` independently. `l4d.setting("radar.selector", "style", index)` selects the editor only, with indices 0â€“18 in that order.

```lua
features.set("overlay.radar", true)
features.set("radar.type_colors", true)
features.set("radar.color.tank", true)
features.color("radar.color.tank", 1, 0.15, 0.2, 1)
features.color("radar.color.medical", 0.3, 1, 0.5, 0.85)
-- Disabled overrides inherit the native Radar Team/Enemy colors.
features.set("radar.color.common", false)
```

The master defaults off. Host schema 6 saves colors, override states, keys and the selected type. Loading an older/partial profile clears absent radar activation/bindings and restores absent type defaults; explicit radar entries are preserved. The existing survivor/infected/pickup, death, ownership and range checks still decide which contacts exist. The adapter uses its existing verified classification and does not infer relationships from display names. Zero alpha hides that contact, including its dot outline/name. Invalid host colors fall back safely. Settings are shared between L4D1 and L4D2; unavailable types simply produce no contacts.

### Radar portrait icons

`radar.icons` enables framed portraits/type icons instead of dots. It defaults on for new profiles; profiles without this ID retain dots. Eight stock survivors use their matching portrait. Infected, weapons and supplies use their type icon, with a generic survivor icon for unrecognized custom player models. Frames use the existing independent radar color, and its alpha also controls the portrait. Zero alpha still hides the whole contact. Icons remain upright as the radar rotates.

```lua
features.set("radar.icons", true)
l4d.setting("radar.icon_size", "distance", 24) -- 12..40 design pixels
features.color("radar.color.tank", 1, 0.15, 0.2, 1)
-- Revert to the existing dots:
features.set("radar.icons", false)
```

Host schema 7 saves icon mode/size through the ordinary feature config. The controls are in Visuals > Radar > Radar icons. Portrait images are embedded in the module and uploaded with the managed UI texture; no separate image folder, Steam avatar request or per-contact file access is required.

## VFX library and previews

The dedicated **VFX** sidebar page contains **Presets**, **Sky**, **Lighting**, and **Materials**. Existing `world.*` and `chams.*` IDs are retained. Selecting a sky card selects its saved style; **Apply preset** also enables the sky and coordinated world/prop/sky colors. Restore world disables those overrides and both world animations. A material card changes only the selected target/layer's material, preserving switches, colors and bindings.

New appended chams IDs: **19 Dark Matter**, **20 Acid**, **21 Vortex**, **22 Hologram** (additive), **23 Frost**, **24 Inferno**, **25 Circuit** (additive), **26 Pearl**. All use the existing engine TextureScroll proxy. Color-animation speed changes color/opacity animation; texture flow uses its material's fixed scroll rate.

`l4d.vfx_card(kind, style, selected [, width, height, animate, pass_id, caption])` draws an interactive texture card inside a UI drawing callback and returns whether it was clicked. `kind` is `"sky"` (styles 0â€“11) or `"material"` (styles 12â€“26). Width is 16â€“1200 pixels; height is 16â€“800. Optional `caption` adds a label footer and selected-state checkmark inside the clickable card; its height is included in the requested height. Optional `pass_id` applies that layer's color and custom animation to the material preview. The preview is a texture swatch; model UVs, scene lighting and post-processing determine the final game appearance. Do not call from loading or update callbacks. Preview images share the managed font-atlas lifecycle; script shutdown releases their rectangles.

Sky replacement scans once per second for late-loaded map materials, accepts custom material paths and case-insensitive face suffixes, and can derive the face from a texture name. Original material/texture references survive queued restoration. No shader layout is guessed for a custom map: unsupported face names or legacy three-exposure HDR remain unmodified. Maps without visible sky geometry cannot display a skybox override.


## Custom material library

`l4d.user_materials([action])` returns `entries, folder, errors`. Each entry contains `id`, `name`, `animated`, `installed` and `preview`. An omitted action reads the cached library. `refresh` scans files, `open` opens the active materials folder, and `example` copies the bundled example without overwriting user files. These actions return readable errors in the third result.

`l4d.user_material(pass [, id])` reads or selects a custom material for a registered chams layer, such as `chams.held.custom`, `chams.held.hidden` or `chams.held.overlay`. ID 0 restores the built-in material. Unknown imported IDs and invalid layers are rejected. Saved missing selections keep their ID and render with the built-in fallback until the file returns.

`l4d.vfx_card("user", id, selected, width, height, animate [, pass [, caption]])` draws a custom thumbnail inside a UI callback. Matching basename PNG takes priority over GIF; GIF frames use their animation delays when `animate` is true. Without either file, it uses the VTF thumbnail. PNG/GIF artwork is displayed as supplied; VTF swatches can show texture scrolling and layer tint. Refresh invalidates cached images. See `docs/USER_MATERIALS.md` in the source for supported input formats.


## Extra movement controls, native glow and team HUD

Movement > Exploits provides `exploits.speed` and `exploits.lag`, using the existing enable and keybind APIs. `l4d.setting("exploits.speed_factor", "distance", n)` selects 1..32 extra client movement calls; `exploits.lag_factor` selects a 1..999 outgoing sequence increment. These commands require the existing loopback session, a living local player and an unblocked game input state. They stop on menu capture, death, disconnect or Stop. Extra calls do not guarantee a matching server speed increase. Sequence numbers are never rewound on disable.

Visuals > Glow enables `glow.enabled` for the verified L4D2 client. Category switches/colors are `glow.survivors`, `glow.specials`, `glow.common` and `glow.items`. `glow.flash` enables flashing; `glow.range` is a distance field in meters (1..300). RGB selects the native glow color; alpha zero skips the override, and intermediate alpha does not change native glow opacity. L4D1 leaves these settings inactive because it lacks the verified glow receive-property layout. Existing chams material Glow remains available separately.

```lua
features.set("glow.enabled", true)
features.set("glow.survivors", true)
features.color("glow.survivors", 0.3, 0.8, 1, 1)
l4d.setting("glow.range", "distance", 75)
features.set("hud.team", true)
l4d.setting("hud.y", "distance", 30)
```

Visuals > HUD contains `hud.team`, `hud.incap` (incapacitated color), `hud.x` and `hud.y` (0..100 percent of available travel), `hud.width` (180..480 design pixels), and `visual.no_vomit`. The HUD lists living teammate survivors, their stock character name or a generic fallback, and permanent HP. Temporary pill/adrenaline health is not included. Unknown incapacitated maximum HP shows its numeric value without a guessed fill percentage. This HUD works independently of ESP and radar. Boomer overlay removal restores the material's original NO_DRAW flag when disabled, on level shutdown or Stop.

All five master toggles default off and support standard bindings/config saving. Host schema 9 clears absent new master toggles and their bindings when loading older or partial profiles, preventing previous activation from carrying over. Explicit values are retained. No damage, one-shot or infinite-ability settings are exposed without a working implementation; see `docs/RZ_FEATURES.md` in the source.


### Optional auto-fire per aim profile

`features.set("aim.autofire", true)` enables Legit auto-fire; `features.set("aim.rage.autofire", true)` controls Rage independently. Both default off and accept the ordinary feature bindings. The selected profile and its aim enable/key must also be active. Auto-fire checks the selected hitbox ray, ammo, reload and cooldowns; camera smoothing finishes alignment before firing. It generates release commands for semiautomatic weapons and preserves manual fire. Host schema 10 clears absent auto-fire activation/bindings on legacy or partial profile loads. Camera/Silent/pSilent mode IDs remain 0/1/2.

## L4D native function hooks

`l4d.native.version == "1.1"` identifies this optional native extension. Existing `L4D_API_VERSION == "1.0"` snapshot scripts remain compatible. Native hooks are available in the Win32 game host during its existing allowed-session gate. The standalone preview does not enable them. Native hooks require a host that contains this extension; updating the website/docs does not update an installed DLL. Test `l4d.native and l4d.native.available` before using 1.1 helpers.

| Function | Return |
| --- | --- |
| `l4d.native.available()` | Boolean: whether this host currently permits native discovery/hooks. Safe to check while loading, disconnected or in preview. |
| `l4d.native.module(name)` | `{base, size}` for a loaded x86 module, or `nil, error`. Addresses are unsigned 32-bit Lua integers. No DLL is loaded by this API. |
| `l4d.native.export(module, name)` | Export address, or `nil, error`. Use the exact exported name, including calling-convention decoration where present. |
| `l4d.native.scan(module, pattern [, occurrence])` | Address in committed, readable executable pages, or `nil, error`. Pattern tokens are hex bytes, `?` or `??`, separated by whitespace. By default a match must be unique; an explicit positive occurrence selects that match in address order. Limit: 256 bytes and 100 ms per scan. |
| `l4d.native.hook(address, signature, source [, options])` | Script-owned hook handle, or `nil, error`. Target must be executable code in a loaded module. A function already hooked by the host or another script is rejected. Use `{enabled=false}` to initialize shared settings before enabling; default is enabled. |
| `hook:enable(boolean)` | Enables/disables interception. Disabled hooks forward to the original. A faulted hook must be removed and recreated. |
| `hook:remove()` | Idempotently retires the callback. Later calls forward to the original; this handle cannot be re-enabled. |
| `hook:status()` | `{address, enabled, active, removed, calls, bypassed, errors, error}`. `enabled` is the requested state; `active` also checks the current session gate. Busy/nested calls can still bypass. `error` includes the hook identity, traceback and recovery advice. |
| `hook:set(key, value)` / `hook:get(key)` | Exchanges a copied scalar with the callback's `shared.set` / `shared.get`. Values: nil, boolean, integer, finite number or string. Nil deletes a key. Limits: 64 keys, 64-byte names, 1,024-byte strings. |

`signature` is `{abi="cdecl"|"stdcall"|"thiscall"|"fastcall", returns=type, args={type,...}}`. Supported types: `bool`, `i32`, `u32`, `ptr`, `float`, `double`, and `void` for returns only. There are at most 16 arguments in a dense, one-based array; holes, named keys and zero-based tables are rejected. Numeric strings and names containing NUL bytes are rejected. `thiscall` includes an explicit first `ptr` argument for `this`; `fastcall` puts the first two eligible integer/pointer arguments in ECX/EDX. Floating-point values use the x86 stack/x87 ABI. Structs by value, vectors, varargs, 64-bit integers, custom register conventions and x64 are not supported. A pointer is a numeric address; this API does not dereference pointers or provide arbitrary function calls or memory writes.

The source string runs once in a **separate Lua state** and must return `function(original, ...)`. It has base/table/string/math/utf8 libraries and `shared`, with no UI, `features`, `events`, `l4d`, file/process/debug/loading or protected-call APIs. It cannot capture variables from the UI script. Local variables inside the source persist between calls. Use shared scalars to pass feature switches/settings into it and copied telemetry back to UI callbacks.

A callback can replace arguments by calling `original(...)`, replace the result by returning another value, or skip the original entirely. Call `original` at most once per invocation, with exactly the declared argument count/types. `void` callbacks return nothing. Do not save `original` for later work.

```lua
-- Template only: use a function entry and ABI you verified for the current game.
local function install_hook(module_name, verified_pattern, verified_signature)
    local address, err = l4d.native.scan(module_name, verified_pattern)
    if not address then return nil, err end
    return l4d.native.hook(address, verified_signature, [[
        return function(original, ...)
            shared.set("calls", (shared.get("calls") or 0) + 1)
            return original(...)
        end
    ]])
end
-- local hook, err = install_hook("client.dll", YOUR_PATTERN, YOUR_SIGNATURE)
```

Callbacks execute synchronously on the calling native thread. Concurrent calls to a busy callback VM and nested hooks forward directly to their originals; callbacks therefore must not require seeing every invocation. Each VM is limited to 2 MiB, initialization to 50 ms / 1,000,000 Lua instructions, and callbacks to 2 ms / 100,000 instructions, checked every 1,000 instructions. Time spent in a native original or a long C library operation cannot be preempted.

A Lua error, bad return value or instruction-budget failure disables the callback and records its error. The host posts it once to **Lua > Console** at Error level on the next UI frame (or during removal). Reports identify the script, native address, source line and traceback. Polling `hook:status()` does not duplicate the log. If it already called the original, that result is preserved without repeating its side effects. Windows `GetLastError` input/output is preserved through interception, bypass and Lua-error fallback. Otherwise the unmodified original is called. This protects against Lua errors, **not an incorrect native address, signature, unsafe argument or engine thread violation**; those can crash the process. Verify function boundaries and ABIs separately for each game/build. Do not hook allocator, synchronization, Lua, MinHook or host bridge internals.

Stop, reload, failed initial script execution and host teardown automatically retire the owning script's hooks. An already-running callback may finish. At most eight active hooks belong to one script. Targets, modules and machine-code trampolines remain pinned as pass-through bridges until process exit, so there is no race freeing code beneath a native thread. Reusing a retired address requires the identical signature; at most 128 unique targets can be created per process. `remove()` restores original behavior rather than physically removing the patch. Disconnect/Stop bypasses callbacks through the host gate; manually disabled/failed hooks stay disabled.

The in-process regression executable validates native ABI behavior and lifecycle using fixture functions. It does not establish actual L4D1/L4D2 function signatures, game runtime acceptance, or performance.

### Native hook argument and result example

```lua
-- Only use this helper for a function verified as cdecl float(float).
local function scale_verified_float_function(address)
    local hook, err = l4d.native.hook(address,
        {abi="cdecl", returns="float", args={"float"}}, [[
            return function(original, value)
                local scale = shared.get("scale") or 1
                local result = original(value * scale)
                shared.set("last_result", result)
                return result
            end
        ]], {enabled=false})
    if not hook then return nil, err end
    hook:set("scale", 1.25)
    hook:enable(true)
    return hook
end
```

### Native hook console diagnostics

An error report includes the script name, native address, failing callback line and Lua traceback, followed by the fallback used and a recovery step. Initialization errors are returned as `nil, error` and logged when a reporter is attached. Check returned errors from pattern/export lookup and hook creation; a missing/ambiguous pattern is not a valid function address.

| Console message | What to check |
| --- | --- |
| `signature args must be a dense array indexed from 1` | Use `args={"ptr","float"}`; do not use index 0, holes or field names. |
| `original argument count does not match signature` | For `thiscall`, include `self` first; otherwise supply exactly the declared arguments. |
| `expected a non-empty string without NUL bytes` | Check module/export/type/ABI names and remove embedded NUL characters. |
| `native hook execution budget exceeded` | Split work into short calls; move UI/formatting work to normal updates. Native originals cannot be preempted. |
| `Hook Lua memory limit exceeded (2 MiB)` | Reduce cached tables, large strings and retained per-call data. |
| `function already has a script hook` | Stop the owning script, or choose a different function. Host hooks are not replaced. |
| `retired hook ABI cannot change until process restart` | Recheck the signature, then restart the host before changing it for that address. |
| `The original already ran; its result was preserved` | Fix code after `original(...)`; the host avoided repeating native side effects. |

The complete **L4D Native Hook.lua** template waits for an allowed session, installs once with interception disabled, initializes shared values, and follows a normal configurable feature toggle. It removes a failed hook after the host's single diagnostic instead of printing the same error every frame.
